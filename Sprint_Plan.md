# Magnetic Resonance Network (MRN)
## Master Sprint Framework (Alpha → Delta)

---

# 1. Project Overview

## Project Name
Magnetic Resonance Network (MRN)

## Vision
A decentralized communication network that uses near-field magnetic resonance
as the transmission medium instead of RF or optical waves.

## Core Objectives
- Infrastructure-independent communication
- Operates in challenging environments (underground, underwater, disaster zones)
- Decentralized mesh topology
- High resilience and fault tolerance

## Core Architecture

| Layer | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| Physical | Magnetic resonance signaling |
| Data Link | Framing + CRC + ACK |
| Network | Mesh routing |
| Security | Encryption + Authentication (future sprint) |

# 2. Sprint Structure (Standard 14-Day Sprint)

Each sprint follows the same structure:

Day 1: Sprint Planning  
Day 2–11: Development + Daily Standup  
Day 12–13: Testing + Integration  
Day 14: Sprint Review + Retrospective
